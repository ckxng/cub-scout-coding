  As you've seen a few times, strings can be added together with the plus (+)
  operator to make longer strings. This can even be used to add variables to
  strings. But, when you are putting variables into strings, there is an even
  easier way.

  The fancy name for it is "interpolation". But that's a little hard to say. So
  we're going to call it "substituion". String substitution uses the backtick
  (`) instead of double quotes (") to wrap strings. Then, variables can be
  included using the dollar sign ($) like this <tt>`Hello ${name}!`</tt>. That's
  pretty different, but you'll get the hang of it.

<p>
  (TIP! The backtick (`) is next to the one (1) key on most keyboards.)

<p>
  Here is an example that does it both ways. Give it a try below. Can you write
  a sentence that uses substitution?
