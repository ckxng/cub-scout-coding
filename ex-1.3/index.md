# More Information on Text Editors

While "Notepad" is a perfectly adequate text editor (and is already included on every Windows computer), it is not the best editor to use for writing code.

A popular development editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  Using a purpose-designed development editor has many advantages, including color-coding the text and auto-completing certain words.  Visual Studio Code can also display a "preview" of the file you are working on.

A good development editor makes reading and writing code much easier.
