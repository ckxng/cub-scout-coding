<!doctype html>
<title>Exercise 1.3</title>

<p>This is the simplest website.  If you look at the code of this page, you will see that it contains two tags at the top.</p>

<p>The first of these tags is <tt>&lt;!doctype html></tt>.  This tag tells your web browser that this is an HTML document.  HTML is a way of telling a web browser how a page is supposed to appear on your screen.</p>

<p>The second of these tags is <tt>&lt;title></tt>.  Inside this tag is the title of this page.  All webpages must have a title.</p>

<p>You will also notice that each of these paragraphs is contained inside <tt>&lt;p></tt> tags.  These tags mark the beginning and end of a paragraph.</p>
