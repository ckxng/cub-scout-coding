  Information can be saved into little containers called "variables", that you
  can use over and over in a program. You information to variables with the
  equals (=) operator.

  Let's look back at our first exercise, when we said "Hello world!" What if we
  wanted to say hello and goodbye. If we use a variable, we can re-use some of
  this information a second time.

  Take a look at the example below, and try substituting your own name into the
  variable.
